## 🛠︰Info

This simple yet useful mod for Space Engineers allows players to easily return their rotors to their home position with just the press of a terminal button.
No more manual adjustments or scripts required!

Adds a button to start return the rotor to home position and a slider to set the home position angle to rotor terminal controls.

❗❗❗ Currently only advanced rotors and hinges are supported because of a bug.
If you really want support for it please vote for this at least 3 years old [bug report](https://support.keenswh.com/spaceengineers/pc/topic/mod-api-terminal-controls-cannot-be-added-to-rotors)❗❗❗
