This simple yet useful modification for Space Engineers allows players to easily return their rotors to their home position with just the press of a terminal button.
No more manual adjustments or scripts required!

[h2]🛠︰Info ・─────────────・・・[/h2]
Adds a button to start return the rotor to home position and a slider to set the home position angle to rotor terminal controls.

❗❗❗ Currently only advanced rotors are supported because it's not possible to create terminal controls to IMyStator.
If you really want support for it please vote for this [url=https://support.keenswh.com/spaceengineers/pc/topic/mod-api-terminal-controls-cannot-be-added-to-rotors]bug[/url]❗❗❗
